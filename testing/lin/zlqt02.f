*  Purpose
*  =======
*
*  ZLQT02 tests ZUNGLQ, which generates an m-by-n matrix Q with
*  orthonornmal rows that is defined as the product of k elementary
*  reflectors.
*
*  Given the LQ factorization of an m-by-n matrix A, ZLQT02 generates
*  the orthogonal matrix Q defined by the factorization of the first k
*  rows of A; it compares L(1:k,1:m) with A(1:k,1:n)*Q(1:m,1:n)', and
*  checks that the rows of Q are orthonormal.
*
