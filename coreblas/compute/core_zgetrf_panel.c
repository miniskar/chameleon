 *
 * @param[in] m
 *         The number of rows of the matrix A. m >= 0.
 *
 * @param[in] n
 *          The number of columns of the matrix A. n >= 0.
 *
 * @param[in] h
 *         The index of the column to factorize in the matrix A.
 *
 * @param[in] m0
 *         The number of rows above the diagonale tile A in the global matrix to
 *         be factorized.
 *
 * @param[in,out] A
 *          On entry, the matrix A where column h-1 needs to be factorized, and
 *          pivot for column h needs to be selected.
 *          The lower pentagonal part m-by-(h-1) are the L factors of the LU
 *          decomposition of A for the first (h-1) columns/rows.
 *          The upper pentagonal part (h-1)-by-n are the U factors of the LU
 *          decomposition of A for the first (h-1) columns/rows.
 *          On exit, A is factorized up to the (h-1)^th column/row and the
 *          remaining part is updated. The pivot of column h is selected.
 *
 * @param[in] lda
 *          The leading dimension of the array A. lda >= max(1,m).
 *
 * @param[in,out] IPIV
 *          On entry, the pivot array of size min(m,n) with the first h-2
 *          columns initialized.
 *          On exit, IPIV[h-1] is updated with the selected pivot for the
 *          previous column.
 * *
 * @param[in,out] nextpiv
 *          On entry, the allocated and initialized CHAM_piv_t structure to
 *          store the information related to pivot at stage h.
 *          On exit, the diagrow is initialized with the diagonal h row from A,
 *          and the pivot row is updated if a better pivot is found for step h.
 *
 * @param[in] prevpiv
 *          Holds the CHAM_piv_t structure of the previous (h-1) step with the
 *          (h-1) diagonal row, and the pivot selected row for (h-1) step.
 *          Not referenced if h is equal to 0.
